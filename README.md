# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction 🏥💰

This project aims to predict individual medical insurance costs using machine learning regression models. Accurate cost estimation can help insurance companies, healthcare providers, and policyholders make better financial decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Build a regression model to estimate medical insurance charges.
- Use demographic and lifestyle features (age, BMI, smoking status, region, etc.).
- Apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Medical Cost Personal Dataset]
- Features:
  - **Age**: Age of the individual
  - **Sex**: Gender
  - **BMI**: Body Mass Index
  - **Children**: Number of dependents
  - **Smoker**: Smoking status
  - **Region**: Residential area in the US
  - **Charges**: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize distributions, correlations, and feature impacts.
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables  
   - Scaling numerical features  
   - Interaction terms (e.g., smoker × BMI)
4. **Modeling**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost / Gradient Boosting
5. **Evaluation**  
   Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² score

## 📊 Results
- Compare models based on accuracy and interpretability.
- Visualize predicted vs actual insurance charges.
